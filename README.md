I created an AI prototype for small businesses that helps large marts grow by predicting product sales.
The model analyzes sales data to provide insights into future trends, helping marts make informed inventory and marketing decisions. 
For this project, I used libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, along with XGBoost for accurate sales predictions.
